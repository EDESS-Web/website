            <p class="par-content">At EDESS, we believe in equal opportunity, technology literacy, and environmental responsibility.<br>

                In today’s day and age, technology literacy is becoming increasingly important for success in the evolving workforce. However, many children lack the resources necessary to purchase a computer or the training required to use them. Not only that, the rapid pace of technology consumption and turnover means that over 52.2 million tons of hazardous e-waste is created each year in the world.</p>

We pick up the devices from the donor and practice strict data security standards.
